This is the only lab where I got a point off. According to the grader "For question 2, A correct sequence should toggle the lock/unlock state".
That's what I thought I had already done, but be aware that it's an issue for question 2.
I also no longer have a Boolean Board to test my corrected code, so I just left it as it was when I submitted it.
If you encounter errors, specifically during BitStream generation, look at your constraints file. Some constraint files have slightly different variable names, like "mclk" instead of "clk" or "D0_an" instead of "D0_AN".
