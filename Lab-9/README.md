**Every final exam is different for each semester but about 30% of my final exam was on the stuff you learn in this lab.**

The concepts in this lab are very critical to the understanding of content later on in this class.
Because of this, I left everything uncommented to let you come up with your own descriptions for what's happening. 
You will also use the shift register throughout later labs, so make sure that it is easily accessible.
