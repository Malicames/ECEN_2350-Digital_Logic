This was my final project for this class and I went far beyond what was required. 
I did all the extra credit opportunities receiving 12+ points of extra credit.
Most of my explanations of how my code works are in the Code Explanation txt. and I highly recommend throwing it into a google doc for readability. 
If I had to take this class again, I would try to make Tetris instead of a Tug-of-War game.
And if you have been following along with my code or just decided to look at my final project, I would highly encourage you to do Tetris as an addition to my final project.
Professor Kooros will be amazed to see that. 
It took me only about an hour or two to come up with the game logic for Tug-of-War and over 12 hours for the HDMI display. 
Not to mention at least 8 to 10 hours for reformatting, fixing bugs like "The Artifact" display line, and writing my comments/explanations. 
If you haven't already, feel free to download the required IPs and play my game, I hope you enjoy it!
